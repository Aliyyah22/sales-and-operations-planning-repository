## Project description
In this project, I am going to simulate a sales and operations planning using the zero-stock level strategy. I will write a program that asks the user to enter the following data:
1. An initial stock level for a product
2. The number of month(s) to plan
3. The planned sales quantity for each month
Based on this data, I will calculate the required production quantity as follows:
1. If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0
2. If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is the difference.
